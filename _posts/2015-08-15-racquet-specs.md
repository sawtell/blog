I'm a bit of a gear junkie. With every sport there are companies that want to make money and every year promise "*innovation*". Tennis is no different.

History will show that I have been pretty fickle with my racquet of choice. Sometimes my switch has been justified for example when I had tennis elbow and had to opt for a more *arm friendly* stick.

However... With that said I think I have found the one, or at least close enough. Enter Tecnifibre TFight ltd 16x19.

Below is a reference that won't really be of any use to anyone but myself. Sorry.
